# HuffmanCoding
 Huffman Coding algorithm for file compression.

 There is a python file added to the repo called generate_random_text.py, which generates random text and saves it as a file. The compression algorithm then uses this file. You can play around with the length of the random text to see how the compression algorithm performs. 
If you change the name of the file being outputted by generate_random_text.py, make sure to update the "input file" in the main method of huffmanCompression.cpp
