# HuffmanCoding
 Huffman Coding algorithm for file compression.

 # Python file instructions
 There is a python file added to the repo called generate_random_text.py, which generates random text and saves it as a file. The compression algorithm uses this file to run the compression algorithm on. You can play around with the length of the random text to see how the compression algorithm performs. 
 # Instructions for running huffmanCompression.cpp
If you change the name of the file being outputted by generate_random_text.py, make sure to update the "input file" in the main method of huffmanCompression.cpp
